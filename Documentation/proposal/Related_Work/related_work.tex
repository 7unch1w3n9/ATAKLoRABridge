\section{Background and Related Work}
Recently, emergency communication has been widely studied from multiple perspectives, particularly in the context of frequent communication infrastructure failures during natural disasters or large-scale crises. This section provides a systematic overview of existing research. Section 2.1 reviews three fundamental post-disaster communication strategies: Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) relays, and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). Section 2.2 introduces the rise of LoRa in emergency scenarios. Section 2.3 discusses existing LoRa-based emergency communication solutions, with a focus on the open-source project Meshtastic. Section 2.4 focuses on the recent emergence of software-defined LoRa gateways.
